# Motivation of the questions

## What is the common ground?
- Empirically
- Theoretically [target audience Important in terms of positioning and reviewing process]

## What is the phenomenon that twist the common ground?
- empirically different results
- theoretically different mechanisms

## What needs to be theorized?
- new mechanism needs to be theorized


# Research question(s)

## What is the question?
- In question form

## Challenges to answer this question? 
- What is the closely related theory and why it cannot address? [audience]
- what are preferral theories that can address but needs more work on?


# Conceptualization

## Overaching theoretical frames: 
1. Definition of construct
2. What conditions determine the influence of the construct

## Elaboration of theoretical frames: 
3. Theoretical arguments/framework 
Major concepts/constructs
Relationships among the concepts/constructs
Underlying mechanism
Use a figure or graph to illustrate if helpful

# Hypotheses

Logic that leads to Hypothesis 1
Internally coherent in terms of logic – reasoning has to be strong, esp. if without math model
Support with qualitative evidence, if needed: Examples from the “real world” – interviews/surveys/industry reports can help
Theory in logic vs. theory in use
Be clear about the logical alternative hypotheses that we will accept if the null hypotheses are rejected
State H1 explicitly and clearly


# Statistical models

Identify the statistical model that corresponds to the theoretical model
Discuss the functional form of the model
Discuss the error assumptions and any other assumptions that you make
Theoretical and empirical justification 


# Data and sample

In empirical analysis, match between theory, methods and measures is critical 

One of the challenges of research is to obtain data that are consistent with the constructs in the theoretical model and that are useful in analyzing a problem

# Phenomenon/context
Why desirable for theory testing? 

- Discuss the appropriateness of your data within the theoretical and statistical models
- Sources of data
  Why data appropriate with regard to theory and hypotheses?
  Appropriate choice of industry, location, time frame, etc?
  
  How did you get to the final sample for empirical analysis 
  Rule of thumb: Be so clear that readers can rely on your description to replicate your study


# Variables and measures

## Dependent variable (DV)
Measure(s)
How to measure?
Why measure this way? 
Theoretical/ empirical justification
Any prior study using this measure?
Source of data?
Nature of measure, e.g., time-varying? industry-specific? location-specific?
Independent/explanatory variables (IV)
Measure(s)


## Control variables

Control primarily for alternative explanations/ interpretations/stories and variables used in existing studies
Don’t just list, categorize them into groups, e.g.:
From alternative theory/explanation
Firm-, industry-, country-level?


# Results 

DESCRIBE results for each hypothesis
STATE whether the hypothesis is STATISTICALLY supported or not 
Discuss the economic significance/magnitude of effects for each main variable 
graphs/charts help, esp. for non-linear effects or interaction effects
Briefly describe results for control variables, if necessary


# Robustness tests

Endogeneity
Omitted variables? sample selection?...
Identification 
Causal mechanisms?
Alternative statistical model
Alternative measures
…


# Discussion and conclusion 

Explain/discuss what the main results mean 
Theoretical/conceptual implications 
Empirical implications 
Practical implications 
Limitations of the study
Extensions of the study/ future research
