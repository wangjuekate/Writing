None of the correlation coefficients are above 0.7 in magnitude. For those that are above 0.3, we checked (1) the consistency of their regression coefficients and zero-order correlation with the dependent variable in terms of the sign and (2) when two variables are positively (negatively) correlated, their coefficients do not exhibit opposite (negative) signs to ensure that Type I error did not affect our results (Kalnins, 2018). We also checked variance inflation factors and found that the largest one XXX is below 10. Taking these together, we suggest that multicollinearity does not pose a serious threat to our analysis.
